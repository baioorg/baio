# mytools/select_tool.py Documentation

## Overview

This module provides functionality to select the most appropriate tool for answering a user's question. It defines a `MyTool` class to represent individual tools and a `ToolSelector` class to encapsulate the selection process.

## Classes

### MyTool

This class represents an individual tool that can be used to answer questions.

#### Attributes:
- `name` (str): The name of the tool.
- `func` (Optional[Callable[..., str]]): The function associated with the tool.
- `description` (str): A description of what the tool does.

### ToolSelector

This class represents the selected tool after the selection process.

#### Attributes:
- `name` (str): The name of the best fitting tool to answer the question.
- `description` (str): The description of the best fitting tool.

## Functions

### select_best_fitting_tool

This function selects the most appropriate tool to answer a given question.

#### Parameters:
- `question` (str): The user's question.
- `tools` (list): A list of available tools (instances of `MyTool`).
- `llm`: The language model to use for tool selection.

#### Returns:
- An instance of `ToolSelector` representing the selected tool.

#### Process:
1. Creates a prompt for the language model using `ChatPromptTemplate`.
2. Uses `create_structured_output_runnable` to create a function that will output a `ToolSelector` instance.
3. Invokes the created function with the question and available tools.
4. Returns the selected tool.

## Usage

To use this module:

1. Import the necessary classes and functions:
   ```python
   from baio.src.mytools.select_tool import MyTool, select_best_fitting_tool
   ```

2. Define your tools:
   ```python
   tools = [
       MyTool(name="Tool1", func=tool1_function, description="Description of Tool1"),
       MyTool(name="Tool2", func=tool2_function, description="Description of Tool2"),
       # ... more tools ...
   ]
   ```

3. Use the `select_best_fitting_tool` function:
   ```python
   question = "User's question here"
   selected_tool = select_best_fitting_tool(question, tools, llm)
   ```

4. Use the selected tool:
   ```python
   print(f"Selected tool: {selected_tool.name}")
   print(f"Tool description: {selected_tool.description}")
   ```

## Notes

- The module uses the `LLM` class from `baio.src.llm` to get an instance of the language model.
- The tool selection process is based on the language model's understanding of the question and the descriptions of the available tools.
- The module is designed to be flexible and can work with any number of tools, as long as they are properly defined using the `MyTool` class.

This module plays a crucial role in the BaIO system by intelligently selecting the most appropriate tool to handle user queries, enhancing the system's ability to provide accurate and relevant responses.

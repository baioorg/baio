Hello. Your task is to use NCBI Web APIs to answer genomic questions.
You can call Eutils by: "[https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/{esearch|efetch|esummary}.fcgi?db={gene|snp|omim}&retmax={}&{term|id}={term|id}]".
esearch: input is a search term and output is database id(s).
efectch/esummary: input is database id(s) and output is full records or summaries that contain name, chromosome location, and other information.
Normally, you need to first call esearch to get the database id(s) of the search term, and then call efectch/esummary to get the information with the database id(s).
Database: gene is for genes, snp is for SNPs, and omim is for genetic diseases.

For questions about DNA sequences (other than genome alignments) you can use BLAST by: "[https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi?CMD={Put|Get}&PROGRAM=blastn&MEGABLAST=on&DATABASE=nt&FORMAT_TYPE={XML|Text}&QUERY={sequence}&HITLIST_SIZE={max_hit_size}]".
BLAST maps a specific DNA {sequence} to DNA sequences among different specices. Do not use this if you are given a organism name and asket to aligning a sequence with its genome.
Use it if you need other information about a DNA sequence, see example questions 1 and example question 2.
You need to first PUT the BLAST request and then GET the results using the RID returned by PUT.

For DNA sequence alignments to a specific genome and/or organisms ALWAYS uscs genome browser by:"[https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?userSeq={sequence}&type={query_type}&db={database}&output=json]
Use it when you want exact loci/coordinates for a sequence on an organisms genome.
First you have to identify what organism you are aligning the sequenc to, for this select the correct one in the ucsc file.
For DNA sequence alignments to the human genome you MUST use the uscs genome browser by: "[https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?userSeq={sequence}&type={query_type}&db={database}&output=json]".
This maps specific DNA {sequence} to the {database} (database:orgnaism specific) to find its exact locus.
See example questions 3 and 4

Example Question 2: Which gene is SNP rs1217074595 associated with?
For SNP ids, ALWAYS strip "rs" Prefix: only use the number as id.
The url should look like this ->[https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esummary.fcgi?db=snp&retmax=10&retmode=json&id=1217074595]
